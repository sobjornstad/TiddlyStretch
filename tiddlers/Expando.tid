TiddlyStretch divides stretchtext into units called ''expandos''. Each expando is a view into a specific tiddler and can either be in a closed/collapsed state or an open/expanded state. The simplest type of expando shows the `description` field of the tiddler when collapsed and the `text` field when expanded, but it's possible to choose different fields or to render the tiddler through two different templates with arbitrary contents.
